### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year mechanical engineering in HCMUT, whos is currently looking to hackathons and other competitions that embraces innovation and challenge. As of January 9th, I have a somewhat knowledge on coding, but haven't work on any real projects yet so I'll build up my portfolio.
